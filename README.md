# **OQMobileFinance - Enterprise Kiosk & Finance Management**

1. Project Overview
   OQMobileFinance is a specialized Android application designed for financial management with integrated Enterprise Device Management (EDM) and Kiosk Mode capabilities. The app is built to be deployed on company-owned devices, allowing administrators to remotely control device policies (like camera access, kiosk locking, and remote uninstallation) via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) while providing financial services to users.
2.Features
   •
   Financial Dashboard: Real-time tracking and visualization of financial data .
   •
   Kiosk Mode (COSU): Locks the device to a single application to prevent unauthorized use.
   •
   Remote Policy Management:
   ◦
   Enable/Disable camera remotely.
   ◦
   Remote App Uninstallation/Device Owner clearing.
   ◦
   Remote Kiosk activation/deactivation.
   •
   Push Notifications: Deeply integrated with Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time command execution.
   •
   Secure Authentication: PIN-based security using specialized PinView components.
   •
   Lottie Animations: High-quality UI transitions and feedback.

3. Tech Stack
   •
   Language: Kotlin
   •
   UI Framework: XML (DataBinding/ViewBinding)
   •
   Networking: Retrofit 2 & OkHttp 3
   •
   Local Persistence: Jetpack Room / SharedPreferences
   •
   Async Processing: Kotlin Coroutines & WorkManager
   •
   Dependency Injection: Manual/Standard Android patterns
   •
   UI Components: Material Design, SDP (Scalable DP), SSP (Scalable SP)
   •
   External Libraries: Lottie, MPAndroidChart, PinView
4. Architecture Pattern
   The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern recommended by Google:
   •
   View: Activities and Fragments using ViewBinding to observe ViewModel data.
   •
   ViewModel: Handles UI logic and communicates with the Repository.
   •
   Model: Data classes and API response schemas.
   •
   Repository: Acts as a single source of truth for data from APIs and local storage.
5. Module Explanation
   •
   :app: The main entry point containing UI components and business logic.
   •
   kioskmode: Dedicated logic for DeviceAdminReceiver and KioskPolicyService to handle system-level locks.
   •
   notification: Contains MyFirebaseMessagingService for handling background payloads and remote triggers.
6. API Integration Details
   The app uses Retrofit 2 for RESTful API communication.
   •
   Base URL: https://api.oqpay.in/
   •
   Endpoints: Includes modules for authentication, transaction history, and device registration.
   •
   Interceptors: Logging interceptor included for debugging network requests.

Manual Verification:
•
Once logged in, all subsequent API calls will now include the Bearer Token.
•
If the token expires (after 30 minutes), the app will transparently refresh it without interrupting the user's flow.
•
If the refresh token also expires or is invalid (403), the user will be safely logged out.
